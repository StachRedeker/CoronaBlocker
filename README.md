>CoronaBlocker replaces covid related words with friendlier alternatives.

#### Read the Dutch (:netherlands:) version of this document [here](/README-nl_NL). 

Corona, corona and more corona: it is almost impossible to visit a (news) website without reading about it. CoronaBlocker replaces words like 'corona', 'covid' and 'Sars-CoV' with friendlier alternatives. CoronaBlocker also tells you exacly how many covid related words were found on the webpage.

### Installation 
CoronaBlocker can be installed as Chrome extension or Firefox add-on. I am currently working on getting the program in both app stores.

For now, download the folder `en_EN` from the latest version.

**Chrome:** <br>
Go to [`extensions`](chrome://extensions/) and activate `Developer mode`. Then press `Load unpacked` and navigate to the download location on your computer. Press `select` and you are good to go!

**Firefox:** <br>
Go to [`addons`](about:addons) and navigate to the settings icon. Click `debugging add-ons` and then `load temporary add-on`. Upload a zip-file with the contents of the previously downloaded folder (`en_EN`).
